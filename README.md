# Tic-Tac-Toe-Ransomware

As a beginner project, I tried creating the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Pygame framework and then extended the project's scope to introduce ransomware, employing the Cryptography library for encryption and decryption functionalities.

What I learned from this project:

1. **Comprehensive Understanding of Cryptography**:
   - Understanding the principles and techniques behind cryptography.
   - Mastering the art of encrypting data, ensuring its security and confidentiality.
   - Skillfully decrypting data, allowing for information retrieval in a secure and controlled manner.

2. **File System Manipulation with os Library**:
   - Proficiency in navigating and manipulating files and directories using the os library, a fundamental skill in working with file systems and file operations.
   - Developing the ability to access, modify, and organize files and directories.

3. **File I/O Proficiency**:
   - Gaining experience in reading and writing to files.
   - Acquiring the knowledge to manipulate data stored in files.

4. **Algorithm Design and Implementation for Tic-Tac-Toe**:
   - Crafting algorithms for implementing the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, enhancing problem-solving and logical thinking skills.
   - Learning to create and optimize the game's logic.

In summary, this project provided me with a comprehensive set of skills and knowledge in cryptography, file system operations, data manipulation, and algorithm design while offering practical experience in integrating diverse functionalities into a single software project.
